# Biodiversity_DataExploration

This project is about extracting floristic information from an old Botany journal, dating back to 1885, and enabling to bring this information together with other related information about the plants and the locations where they were spotted. 

The primary types of information that were extracted from this historical journal are as follows: plant names, observers and locations.  There were also other pieces of information that are relevant such as the geographical attributes of a given locality. For example, a particular plant can be found near a river in a given location. Extracting such details as to where the plant was spotted can be very challenging, but can also provide insightful information regarding the place where the plant was found.
